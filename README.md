# BIOMETRIC-AUTHENTICATION-USING-FACIAL-RECOGNITION-AND-REAL-TIME-DATABASE-INTEGRATION
This project uses facial recognition and real-time database integration to identify faces and mark them present. If a face repeats before a set interval-it will not mark it's attendance.

In this project, we will create a real-time Face Attendance system. We 
plan to add a graphical interface along with a live database to create a 
real-world system. 
We use the language python for the implementation of the project. First 
we scan face using webcam, then we check the graphics and load the 
images followed by the encoding generator. Face recognition is done 
using all the components. A database is setup and data is added to it. We 
add the images to the database and a real time database is updated.
We use Visual Studio community edition with C++ compiler to run the 
code. We use various libraries like Open CV(OpenCV uses machine 
learning algorithms to search for faces within a picture. Because faces are 
so complicated, there is not one simple test that will tell you if it found a 
face or not. Instead, there are thousands of small patterns and features that 
must be matched), numPy(This returns a list containing the coordinates of 
the faces it detects within the image) and cvzone(This is a Computer 
vision package that makes it easy to run Image processing and AI 
functions. At the core it uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries).
We use some libraries like pickle as support for the project and connecting 
various elements.
We set up the database using the firebase console
